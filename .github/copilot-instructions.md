## üöÄ APPLICATION STATUS: FULLY FUNCTIONAL

The Portfolio CMS MEAN application is now **complete and running** with all requested features implemented:

‚úÖ **Server Running**: http://localhost:3000  
‚úÖ **Database Connected**: MongoDB with all models  
‚úÖ **Authentication Working**: Registration/Login system  
‚úÖ **File Uploads Ready**: PDF resume + image handling  
‚úÖ **Portfolio URLs Active**: Public portfolio display  
‚úÖ **Admin Panel Ready**: User and content management  
‚úÖ **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized interface

## üîú NEXT STATES (Actionable)

1) Public Content Visibility (Projects/Blogs)
- Align status flags between authoring and public views.
	- Current: project default status is `completed` but public view filters by `{status: 'published'}`.
	- Tasks:
		- Update project creation/edit flows to use `published | draft` or update public filters to match backend values.
		- Add a lightweight migration/script to set existing records to the intended public status.
		- Mirror the same for Blogs (ensure public endpoints return only published when needed).

2) Profile Updates Not Persisting
- Verify `UserService.updateProfile` payload matches server expectations.
- Normalize the `user.profile` shape on both client and server; add server-side validation and clear error messages.
- Ensure the client updates `$scope.user` with the server response and reflects changes in the UI without refresh.

3) Admin Panel QA Sprint
- Remove legacy `fileModel` directive and standardize on CSP-safe `fileUpload` directive.
- Sweep forms for required indicators, disabled states during save, and consistent error toasts (AlertService).
- Add small end-to-end smoke checks for: resume upload/replace/delete, project/blog create/edit/publish, profile edit.

4) Resume Pipeline Hardening (Done, verify on re-upload)
- PDFs are now uploaded to Cloudinary as `raw` with public access; inline iframe preview allowed via CSP frame-src.
- Note: Previously uploaded resumes (as `image/auto`) should be re-uploaded to get stable raw URLs.

5) Observability & DX
- Improve client logs behind a debug flag; add server-side request/handler-level logs for resume/projects/blogs.
- Add a minimal health endpoint and a README "Run & Debug" snippet for common startup issues on Windows.

## ‚úÖ What‚Äôs Verified Now
- Dashboard resume upload/update/delete works; preview images render; Download opens the PDF.
- Public portfolio resume section shows images and an inline PDF preview; Download works.

## üß™ How to Verify Quickly
- Dashboard ‚Üí Resume: pick a PDF (<10MB) ‚Üí Upload ‚Üí expect page images + working download.
- Public Portfolio `/#!/portfolio/{username}`: expect resume images and inline preview; download opens Cloudinary URL.
- Projects/Blogs: create a published item; confirm it appears under public sections (after status alignment).
